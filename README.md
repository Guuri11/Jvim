## Features

- **Terminal-based:** JVim operates entirely within the terminal environment, allowing for efficient text editing without the need for a graphical interface.
- **Basic Editing:** Provides essential editing capabilities such as inserting, deleting, and navigating text.
- **Read and Write:** Enables users to both read from and write to text files, making it suitable for various text manipulation tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with JVim, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Guuri11/JVim.git
   ```

2. **Compile and run the text editor:**
   Run the text editor is kinda tricky, first open Intellij and run the project, it will give you the command executed and an error. Now copy that command and execut it in you terminal, and there you go! You can pass the file name as a parameter to open it, otherwise it will create a temp fill which you can save and name it later.

## Usage

Once JVim is running, you can use the following basic commands:

- **Arrow keys:** Navigate within the text.
- **Ctrl + q:** Quit.
- **Ctrl + s:** Save changes to the file.
- **Ctrl + f:** Search in the file.

For more advanced usage and customization options, refer to the source code and documentation.
